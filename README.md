# Procedural Terrain

This is an ongoing project of mine in which I implement and experiment with a variety of terrain generation algorithms. 
I originally wrote this in C# but have ported it over to Three.js for web display.

## Algorithms

Currently: Midpoint Displacement
Written, not ported: Diamond Square, Perlin Noise, Particle Hydraulic Erosion
Planned: Exponentially Distributed Noise, Water Pipe Hydraulic Erosion


## Dependencies

Requires Three.js, React, and dat-gui.

## Usage

Navigate to the downloaded directory and run 'npm start'
